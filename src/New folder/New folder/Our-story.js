                    <p>At Red Cow Dairy, passion and integrity are the main
ingredients in everything they do. This starts from the very
first step of procuring carefully selected milk, all the way
till its products reach your table. You can count on Red
Cow to deliver nutrition and great taste, always.</p>
<p>
Red Cow was founded by Mr. Narayan Majumdar, a Dairy
Technologist, when he took up the challenge of bridging the
gap between rural milk producers and urban consumers.
With decades of dairy procurement experience right from
the grassroots, Mr. Majumdar started his exemplary
entrepreneurial journey with Red Cow Dairy, in 1997.</p>

                    <div className="content">
                    <p>He successfully inculcated within the organisation his 
selfbelief to excel, and ensured commitment to world class
hygiene and quality. His legacy and vision are further
accentuated by his son, Mr. Nandan Majumdar who is on
his way to making Red Cow Dairy more than a milk
company with global presence.</p>
<p>
Today, Red Cow brings to you wholesome products like
milk, flavoured milk, lassi, doi, paneer, ghee, sweets, and
sterilised cream. Being a staunch follower of sustainable
dairy farming and fair trade practices, when you choose
any Red Cow Dairy product, you are also supporting the
local dairy community of East India.</p>
